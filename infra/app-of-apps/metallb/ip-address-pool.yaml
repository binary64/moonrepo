# MetalLB IP Address Pool for bare-metal LoadBalancer services.
#
# This pool provides virtual IPs (VIPs) that MetalLB assigns to
# LoadBalancer-type services. The range should be in the same subnet
# as the node but outside DHCP range to avoid conflicts.
#
# Adjust the address range to match your network:
#   - Must be in the same L2 subnet as cluster nodes
#   - Must not overlap with DHCP or other static assignments
#   - For single-node clusters, even a single IP (/32) is sufficient
